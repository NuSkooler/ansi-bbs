 I. NOTES ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

    Any line in the DTS-0001 document beginning with a | means that it is
    an update from the previous version.

    Any line in the DTS-0001 document beginning with a * means that it is
    currently under debate.

    This document is put together in the  attempt to establish a standard
    file format for information to be passed between BBS software and BBS
    doorware.  Please  leave comments  about missing (non-board specific)
    information or settings that require ammendment.  This  can only be a
    standard if everyone agrees upon its contents. Please contribute.

    The file that these settings appear in should  be called DROPFILE.###
    where ###  represents the  node which  is creating the dropfile.  For
    example  Node 1 would create DROPFILE.001.  The  dafault filename for
    single node BBS is DROPFILE.001.

    If the  users  information  is changed by  the door  called  with the
    DROPFILE file,  these changes should be  written to a new file called
    CHANGES.### where ### represents  the node which is going  to read in
    the changes and alter the users account. This file is optional. It is
    only intended for those BBS's which support bidirectional information
    to be passed between the board and doors.

    It should  be assumed that any door  requiring this file will find it
    in  the default BBS directory  (thus you must  tell the door where it
    is.)

    Doorware authors using this format  should include a freeware copy of
    a dropfile conversion  utility that will convert other dropfile files
    to the  DTS-0001  format.  This utility  is  as yet  undeveloped.  If
    people would  supply me with other dropfile standards,  I could start
    compiling a list and shall write this program for DOS based machines.

    The information being passed from BBS software and doors should be in
    the following  format.   These configuration  settings should  not be
    limited to appear in the dropfile in any specific sequence.

    Settings  found in DROPFILE.### should not be required.  There should
    be developed a list of default settings for each entry.


 II. STANDARD DATA VALUES

    Some standard formats are  proposed for information appearing  inside
    the DROPFILE.### file. These are:

|       Phone numbers:      <country>-<area>-<exchange>-<number>
|           This  is the  format adopted  by the Fidonet  standard and is
|           used in many applications.
|
|       Dates:              <month>/<day>/<year>
|           The year should be  expressed as a four digit quantity due to
|           the impending year 2000. Month ranges from 0 and 12, day ranges
|           from 1 to 31, and year ranges from 0 to 32767 <g>.
|
|       Times:              <hour>:<minute>
|           expressed in 24 hour format. Hour ranges from 0 to 23 and
|           minute ranges from 0 and 59.
|
|       Time till/left:     <minutes>
|           All time until and time left  commands should be expressed in
|           minutes. Minutes range from 0 to 32767.
|
|       Net addresses:      <zone>:<net>/<node>.<point>@<organization>
|           Expressed  as a 5d net  address including the zone,  network,
|           node, optional point, and optional organization. These values
|           (except the organization of course) have values between 0 and
|           32767.
|
|       File sizes:         <kilobytes>
|           Expressed in number of kilobytes. Kilobytes range from 0 to
|           2147483647 (signed long).
|
|       Ons and offs:       <n|0>
|           Expressed as the value n or 0 for ON or OFF whereas n is any
|           non-zero value.
